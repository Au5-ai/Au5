docker run --network=au5 -e "ACCEPT_EULA=Y" -e "SA_PASSWORD=!qaz@wsx" -p 1433:1433 --name sqlserver -d mcr.microsoft.com/mssql/server:2022-lts

## üîå Redis Setup (with Docker or Podman)

This project uses Redis for caching or other services. If you don't have a Redis instance running already, you can start one using Docker or Podman.

### Start Redis Container

**Using Docker:**

```bash
docker run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
```

**Using Podman:**

```bash
podman run -d --name redis -p 6379:6379 docker.io/library/redis
```

This will run a Redis container accessible at localhost:6379.

üõ†Ô∏è Configuration Notes

The application is set up to connect to Redis at:

```bash
localhost:6379
```

If you are running Redis on a different host or port or
using a Docker network or a cloud Redis provider (like Azure Redis, AWS ElastiCache, etc.),

üëâ You must update your Redis connection string in your configuration file:

```bash
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "Redis": "localhost:6379"
}
```
