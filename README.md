Au5 is a comprehensive AI-powered meeting assistant platform that provides real-time transcription, AI analysis, and meeting management capabilities. The platform consists of multiple microservices that work together to deliver a seamless meeting experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Au5 platform consists of the following modules:

- **Backend** (.NET 9): Core API and business logic with SignalR hubs
- **Panel** (Next.js): Web-based admin panel and user interface
- **Bot** (Node.js/TypeScript): Meeting bot for joining and transcribing meetings
- **BotFather** (Go): Container orchestration service for managing bot instances
- **AI Engine** (Python/FastAPI): AI processing and analysis services
- **Extension** (TypeScript): Browser extension for meeting integration

## üìã Prerequisites

Before installing Au5, ensure you have one of the following container runtimes installed:

### For Docker Installation:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/) or Docker Engine
- Docker Compose v2.0 or higher

### For Podman Installation:

- [Podman](https://podman.io/getting-started/installation) v4.0 or higher
- Podman Compose (optional, for Docker Compose compatibility)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/Au5.git
   cd Au5/modules
   ```

2. **Start all services using Docker Compose:**

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

3. **Initialize the database:**

   ```powershell
   # On Windows
   .\init-database-v2.ps1

   # On Linux/macOS
   chmod +x init-database-v2.ps1
   ./init-database-v2.ps1
   ```

4. **Access the services:**
   - **Panel (Frontend)**: http://localhost:1368
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:1366
   - **Bot Father**: http://localhost:1367
   - **SQL Server**: localhost:1433
   - **Redis**: localhost:6379

### Option 2: Podman Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/Au5.git
   cd Au5/modules
   ```

2. **Create the Au5 network:**

   ```bash
   podman network create au5
   ```

3. **Start all services using the Podman script:**

   ```powershell
   # On Windows
   .\start-podman.ps1

   # On Linux/macOS
   chmod +x start-podman.ps1
   ./start-podman.ps1
   ```

4. **Initialize the database:**

   ```powershell
   # On Windows
   .\init-database-v2.ps1

   # On Linux/macOS
   chmod +x init-database-v2.ps1
   ./init-database-v2.ps1
   ```

5. **Access the services:**
   - **Panel (Frontend)**: http://localhost:1368
   - **Backend API**: http://localhost:1366
   - **Bot Father**: http://localhost:1367
   - **SQL Server**: localhost:1433
   - **Redis**: localhost:6379

## üõë Stopping Services

### Docker

```bash
# Stop all services
docker-compose down

# Stop and remove volumes (WARNING: This will delete all data!)
docker-compose down -v
```

### Podman

```bash
# Stop all services
./stop-podman.ps1

# Or manually:
podman pod stop au5-pod
podman pod rm -f au5-pod  # This removes all containers
podman volume rm sqlserver_data redis_data  # This deletes all data
```
