Au5 is a comprehensive AI-powered meeting assistant platform that provides real-time transcription, AI analysis, and meeting management capabilities. The platform consists of multiple microservices that work together to deliver a seamless meeting experience.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The Au5 platform consists of the following modules:

- **Backend** (.NET 9): Core API and business logic with SignalR hubs
- **Panel** (Next.js): Web-based admin panel and user interface
- **Bot** (Node.js/TypeScript): Meeting bot for joining and transcribing meetings
- **BotFather** (Go): Container orchestration service for managing bot instances
- **AI Engine** (Python/FastAPI): AI processing and analysis services
- **Extension** (TypeScript): Browser extension for meeting integration
